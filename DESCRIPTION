Major Project for CMSC222 @ FCC

1. Who are the users of the software?
The primary users of this Task Manager application include:

Individuals: Those seeking a personal productivity tool to manage daily tasks, deadlines, and priorities.
Teams/Organizations: Small to mid-sized groups managing multiple projects who need task delegation and tracking.
Project Managers: Users who need a centralized overview of tasks, upcoming deadlines, and task prioritization.

2. What is the purpose of the software?
The software provides a user-friendly desktop interface for:

Creating and managing tasks with customizable properties (title, due date, priority, category)
Organizing tasks by category, due date, and priority
Persisting task data with save/load functionality
Processing tasks in a queue-based workflow
Searching through tasks with both keyword filtering and efficient data structures (Binary Search Tree, Hash Table)
Displaying real-time summaries such as task count and high-priority indicators

3. Where and when will the software be used?
WHERE: On desktop or laptop environments (e.g., Windows/macOS/Linux) for individual or team-based productivity use.
WHEN: Used routinely throughout the day to create, update, sort, and complete tasksâ€”especially useful in deadline-driven workflows.

4. How does the software work?
Task Creation: Users input title, due date, priority, and category (Work, Personal, Other).
Task Management: Tasks can be added, deleted, saved to a file, and loaded later. Tasks are also sortable by priority.
Search & Categorization:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) allows efficient searching of tasks by title.
A Hash Table provides descriptions for categories to enhance user understanding.
Task Processing: Tasks are processed in First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order using a queue structure.
Live Search: Real-time keyword filtering updates the displayed task list based on user input.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in a plain text format and can be saved and loaded between sessions.

5. Why would anyone want to use this software over existing processes?
Efficiency: Centralizes task information with a GUI, reducing reliance on manual tracking methods like notebooks or spreadsheets.
Organization: Task sorting, searching, and categorization allow users to quickly access and prioritize their workload.
Reliability: Save/load features and structured task processing ensure data is not lost and tasks are not overlooked.
Smart Search: Use of BST and Hash Tables provides efficient search and categorization behind the scenes.
